A summary of the available research on poultry culling rates.

###Time from detection to culling
The National Wildlife Health Center has [press releases](https://www.nwhc.usgs.gov/disease_information/avian_influenza/) about outbreaks of avian influenza. Its values for $t_c$-detect:

- 1 to 2 days in developed countries (Austria, Poland, Taiwan, US)

- 4 to 6 days in developed countries with other considerations: an Austrian zoo had to test a flock of endangered pelicans to confirm infection before euthanizing them

- 6 to 21 days, if my interpretation of the site is correct (for example, the bulletin was dated 3/22, and said that the flock "will be" culled after an outbreak confirmed on 3/16). Assuming this means that the infection was detected before the first date and the flock has note yet been culled by the second, $t_c$-detect can be as high as 14 (Nepal) or 21 (Russia) days.

###From Paperpile
Hosseini's model `r citep('10.1371/journal.pone.0080091')` gives base values for number of dead birds in a given period ($\tau$ = 1), a threshold value ($\iota$ = 5), and a probability of reporting and detecting ($\pi$~Report~ = 0.1, $\pi$~Detect~ = 0.9).

- Total probability of culling = $\pi$~Report~ * $\pi$~Detect~ = 0.09

Pandit's model `r citep('10.1038/srep02175')` uses a culling probability of 1/7 due to assumption that infected poultry were either culled or dead within 7 days of the infection. 

Dent's model `r citep('10.1186/1746-6148-7-59')` sets a culling parameter for each simulation (see Table 1) depending on whether the farm with the initial infection is in a surveillance zone or not.

- This approach allows them to calculate a time to detection of 2 to 6 days 

There is some data available: Additional File 1 in `r citep('10.1186/1476-072X-8-47')` gives the number of poultry influenza cases and number of poultry culled per country.

Loth et al. `r citep('10.1016/j.prevetmed.2010.05.013')` give data regarding AI in Bangladesh: 1.6 million poultry have been culled out of 220 million total (0.73%).

Bridges' paper `r citep('10.1086/340044')` uses the culling event after the 1997 Hong Kong epidemic to show that workers occupationally exposed to poultry are at higher risk of flu, but has no hard data about the poultry culled.

To contrast with our approach, Bourouiba's model `r citep('10.1137/100803110')` includes culling in its per capita mortality parameter, not as a separate event.

###From the literature

This paper `r citep('10.3201/eid1812.120616')` on the relationship between vaccination and reporting gives a rate of 0.46 to 0.69 for poultry surveillance ($\pi$-report) in the absence of vaccination efforts. (The reporting rate was about twice what it was when vaccination was ongoing, which the authors believe to be a result of the disproportionate trust in the benefits of vaccination.)

EHA has indentified the lack of wild bird surveillance strategies `r citep('10.3201/eid2104.141415')` as an obstacle to understanding the virus, but this paper was limited to wild birds, not poultry.

- A reference `r citep('10.3201/eid1612.100589')` suggests surveillance improvements such as sampling according to age-dependent, temporal, or spatial patterns, sampling different sites of infection, and screening for multiple strains at once; however, this paper also considers only wild birds.

Looking at other livestock, `r citep('10.1111/zph.12049')` advocates pig surveillance to improve our understanding of influenza's ecology and impact on human health, mostly on a laboratory (rather than farm or individual) level. (I was only allowed access to the abstract--I'm going to check with Dartmouth to see why--but this paper seems like an interesting extension idea.)


### Other resources

FAO's [manual](http://www.fao.org/3/a-a1521e.pdf) shows that  >230 million chickens worldwide have died due to flu since 2003, but this number seems to represent mortality due to avian influenza, not deaths due to culling (as some  have cited it).

- Their [FAQs](http://www.fao.org/avianflu/en/qanda.html) suggest that farmers should always report deahts (making $\pi$-report = 1), but do not give rates of compliance.

The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/outbreaks.htm) summarizes the recognized outbreaks in North America.

Article 10.4.29 of the [OIE's handbook](http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_avian_influenza_viruses.htm) gives guidelines for surveillance, namely that $\pi$-detect should be 1.

- The site on [control](http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/web-portal-on-avian-influenza/early-detection-warning-diagnostic-confirmation/) suggests that culling be limited to the infected farm or a small radius around it (perhaps an idea for a modification to the model), and implies that countries which don't compensate affected farmers can see smaller reporting rates.

- A March 2017 [press release](http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/update-on-avian-influenza/2017/) has data on H5 and H7 outbreaks: 827,780 birds were culled between 3/13/17 and 3/27/17, and 5,658,258 total have been culled in ongoing outbreaks (pg 3 of the [situation report](http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/OIE_AI_situation_report/OIE_SituationReport__AI_3_28Mar2017.pdf)).

- A 2014 [press release](http://www.oie.int/for-the-media/press-releases/detail/article/questions-and-answers-on-high-pathogenic-h5n8-avian-influenza-strain-update-27112014/), which puts the total number of birds culled in a 2014 outbreak of HPAI H5N8 at 939,531, breaks the total down by country (Korea, Japan, Germany, Netherlands, UK).

#Other research

[This factsheet](https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/nass-poultry-stats-factsheet.pdf) has some statistics about US poultry slaughter--links to pdfs which may be useful, but won't open over the bus' wifi.


#Summary 
While there is data available about culling numbers (although not as a percentage of total population), and other models have given rates for culling based on assumptions or knowledge about surveillance, there is little synthesis of the two types of reports. The proposed model can use data such as that in `r citep('10.1186/1476-072X-8-47')` to obtain a more accurate culling rate.
